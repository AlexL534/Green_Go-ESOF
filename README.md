### Product Vision

 - **Target Group.**  The academic/FEUP community.


 - **Needs.**  The various initiatives regarding sustainable development don´t have a organized way of transmitting information. Because of this,
many members of the community don´t have the knowledge of their existence or don´t have enough information about what they are tying to promote.
Other problem is the lack of incentive to participate in those activities.


- **Product.** Solves the misleading and confusing information of the various initiatives regarding sustainable development.
  All the information will be in organized in a more organized manner. It will also encourage the community to participate in those initiatives.


- **Benefits.** Improves the enrollment in FEUP's activities related to sustainable development. It also encourages the academic community to actively promote good habits regarding sustainability.


### Main Features

- **Point System.** A system that rewards the user with points when they participate in the activities promoted by FEUP regarding sustainable development.


- **Leaderboard.** A leaderboard system that shows the top community members in terms of points. The members in the top of the leaderboard may receive some prizes.


- **Listing of existent activities.** A list of existence activities with their description, points that they give as reward for participating and some other useful information(depending on the activity).
