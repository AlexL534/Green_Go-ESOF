# _GreenGo_ Development Report

Welcome to the documentation pages of the _GreenGo_!

You can find here details about the _GreenGo_, from a high-level vision to low-level implementation decisions, a kind of Software Development Report, organized by type of activities:

This project is part of the Software Engineering UC.
The main goal is to build a mobile app that addresses the sustainable development in the context of hte academic community.
The app will try to encourage the FEUP community to have better practises regarding sustainable development.

## Business Modelling

### Product Vision

An app to encourage the public to use sustainable mobility by turning the process into a game.

### Features and Assumptions

#### Features

* **Point System** - A system that rewards the user when he uses sustainable means of transport.

* **Leaderboard** - A leaderboard system that shows the top community members in terms of points. The members in the top of the leaderboard may receive some prizes.

* **Selection of transports** - The user can select some different means of transport to start counting the points/receive the points.

* **Verification** - Users need to give some information to the system so that it can verify if the travel was made using sustainable means of transport.

* **Missions** - Users can complete some missions that will reward them with some extra points.

* **Customizable Profile** - Users can customaze their profile (username, date of birth, ...)

* **Mission History** - Users can see their completed missions.

#### Dependencies

* Firebase FireStore for storing users and missions data
* Firebase Authentication for user authentication and registration
* GPS location (Flutter Geolocator Plugin) for trip verification
* Camera (Flutter Camera Plugin) for trip verification

### Elevator Pitch

Draft a small text to help you quickly introduce and describe your product in a short time (lift travel time ~90 seconds) and a few words (~800 characters), a technique usually known as elevator pitch.

Take a look at the following links to learn some techniques:

* [Top 7 Killer Elevator Pitch Examples, by toggl.com](https://blog.toggl.com/elevator-pitch-examples/)

## Requirements

### Domain model

To better understand the context of the software system, it is very useful to have a simple UML class diagram with all the key concepts (names, attributes) and relationships involved of the problem domain addressed by your module.
Also provide a short textual description of each concept (domain class).

**User:** Describes a user of the app (his profile), for example, his name, email, etc...

**Mission** Describes a mission/objective on the app used to receive extra points.

**Status** Decribes the status of a especific misson for a specific user (if the user completed that misson or not).

**Ranking** User's position in the app's leaderboard.

**Leaderboard** List of users ordered by their pointuations.

## Architecture and Design


### Logical architecture

The GreenGo App relies on several external dependencies to enhance user experience and functionality. These include verification protocols for completed missions, GPS integration for precise point calculation, camera access to capture images for specific tasks, and a robust database system to securely store both user and mission data.

### Physical architecture

The user enters the GreenGo app through his smartphone. In the app he can see the leaderboard, profile, missions, he can use even the camera and turn on the GPS. When the user wants to see some data, like his profile. The "User Controller" goes to the database server and enters the "User Database" to find the data about his profile. The same goes to if the user wishes to view the leaderboard or the missions to complete. 

The camera and the GPS is for the validation of his mission. For example, if he is doing a mission that is making a trip with public transport, he uses the GPS and the "GPS Controller" sends the data of the GPS to the "Backend Server" to verify if is valid. The same goes to the camera. The user takes pictures to prove the completion of the mission and then the "Camera Controller" Sends it to the "Verification" sector. Also this two components are allowed to be used in the app because of the "Smatphone Controller" which enables all functions.

#### Vertical prototype

To help on validating all the architectural, design and technological decisions made, we usually implement a vertical prototype, a thin vertical slice of the system integrating as much technologies we can.

In this subsection please describe which feature, or part of it, you have implemented, and how, together with a snapshot of the user interface, if applicable.

At this phase, instead of a complete user story, you can simply implement a small part of a feature that demonstrates they you can use the technology, for example, show a screen with the app credits (name and authors).
