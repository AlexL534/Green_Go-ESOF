The user enters the GreenGo app through his smartphone. In the app he can see the leaderboard, profile, missions, he can use even the camera and turn on the GPS. When the user wants to see some data, like his profile. The "User Controller" goes to the database server and enters the "User Database" to find the data about his profile. The same goes to if the user wishes to view the leaderboard or the missions to complete. 
The camera and the GPS is for the validation of his mission. For example, if he is doing a mission that is making a trip with public transport, he uses the GPS and the "GPS Controller" sends the data of the GPS to the "Backend Server" to verify if is valid. The same goes to the camera. The user takes pictures to prove the completion of the mission and then the "Camera Controller" Sends it to the "Verification" sector. Also this two components are allowed to be used in the app because of the "Smatphone Controller" which enables all functions.
