## Release

[Latest Release](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2023-24/2LEIC10T2/releases/tag/v0.3.0-Sprint3)

## Sprint Retrospective

### What went well?
- We completed everything we proposed for this sprint
- Every team member worked for this Sprint
- The work was well distributed among the team

### What should we do differently?
- We should better manage our time because we had a lot of work for the other courses and the quality of our work was affected by that.

### What still puzzles me?
- The problems with the unit tests and the acceptance tests continued on this sprint
