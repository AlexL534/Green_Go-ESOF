# Product Vision

## Vision Statement

Start by defining a clear and concise vision for your module, to help members of the team, contributors, and users into focusing their often disparate views into a concise, visual, and short textual form. It provides a "high concept" of the product for marketers, developers, and managers.

A product vision describes the essential of the product and sets the direction to where a product is headed, and what the product will deliver in the future.

**We favor a catchy and concise statement, ideally one sentence.**

We suggest you use the product vision template described in the following link:
