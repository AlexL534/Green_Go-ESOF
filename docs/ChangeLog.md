## v0.2.0-Sprint2

### Added
In this version of the app, among other things, we added the score widget, where users can easily see their goal from the main
page, the remaning score that is necessary to reach it, score, and streak.
Futhermore, the plus button at the top takes the user to the score page where more detail is provided
and users can update their goal.

We have also added a mission widget where users can view ongoing missions.
Clicking on any mission displays its details on a dedicated page. Similar to the score widget,
we've added a plus button that, when clicked, directs users to the search page, where they
can look for new missions.
